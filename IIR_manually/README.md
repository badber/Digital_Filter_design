Design a digital IIR filter that meets certain specifications by iteratively hand-placing poles and zeros in the z-plane. This way of designing a filter, although inefficient, helps you understand how the location of poles and zeros affects a filter's response.

Example of the magnitude-response of a designed IIR filter:
